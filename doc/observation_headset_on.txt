F3 sensor:
mean ~8870 oscillate between 8840 and 8900
Artifacts and their impacts :
eye blinking => +30 for about 10 samples
eye moving fast around => +- 150
moving headset slightly =>-+ 100
mouth movement : swallow +-30
heart rate : hard to tell if artifacts are important
breathing : seems like data are oscillating with frequency >1Hz might be reason. Won't appear in frequency spectrum 

F4 sensor:
mean 9250 oscillate between 9200 - 9300
eye blinking => +30 for about 10 samples
eye moving fast around => +- 150

AF3 sensor:
mean 8800 oscillate between 8880
eye blinking => +200 really sensitive to eye blink pic of ~15ms
eye moving around => +200 pic of ~20ms

AF4 sensor:
mean 8950 oscillate between 8900 and 9000
same as AF3 for artifacts

huge artifact at some point without any special reason on AF4 -> value over 11000
Probably due to a movement of the sensor

sensor is not working it starts having a lot of artifacts changing its value by up to 300.

O2 sensor (quality value 16) :
seems not afected by eye blinks
can see a reccurent pattern every second, probably the heart beat
fourier transfrom is flat

The sensor is not giving correct value
