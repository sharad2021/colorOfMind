original signal X: x0,x1,x2,...

I :integrator(X) => EOG, incorrect value or not
	Integrator on time interval ? 
		t1 for eye blink (100-400 ms -> 13-52 packets)
		t2 for mouth movements
		
BW(X, I?): bandpass filter for signal X and transform into Y : y0,y1,y2,...
	BW1 : alpha
	BW2 : beta
	BW3 : min Beta
		Improve by increasing importance of captors at the front of the brain 

Compute ratio:
	Alpha/beta for calm/stressed
	Left/right for valence
	
	Ratio: remove the need for calibrating signals
	
Question is a butterworth filter sufficient to get accurate results ?
Do we need other filtering before using signals ?
